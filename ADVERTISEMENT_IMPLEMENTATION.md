## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
The following dependencies have been added to `pubspec.yaml`:

3. **Create Ad Units**: Create Banner, Interstitial, and Rewarded ad units
4. **Get App ID**: Note down your AdMob App ID

### 3. Configure Real Ad Unit IDs
Currently using test IDs. For production:

1. **Android Configuration**:
   - Replace the App ID in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
   - Change from: `ca-app-pub-3940256099942544~3347511713` (test)
   - To: Your real App ID

2. **Ad Unit IDs**:
   - Use the Admin Dashboard > Ad Configuration to set real ad unit IDs
   - Replace test IDs with your real ad unit IDs from AdMob console

### 4. Firebase Firestore Rules
Ensure these collections have proper rules:
```javascript
// Add to your Firestore rules
match /ad_analytics/{document} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
}

match /admin_config/{document} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null; // Restrict in production
}
```

## Revenue Model

### Estimated Earnings (Industry Standards)
- **Banner Ads**: $0.01 per click
- **Interstitial Ads**: $0.05 per click  
- **Rewarded Ads**: $0.10 per completion

### Revenue Factors

### Revenue Optimization Tips
